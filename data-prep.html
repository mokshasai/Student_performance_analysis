    <h2>Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

    <p>
        This section describes how the data for this project was gathered, cleaned,
        and explored. The goal of this stage is to understand the structure, quality,
        and key characteristics of the data before applying any analytical or
        modeling techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Source</h3>

    <p>
        The primary dataset used in this project is the <strong>Student Performance Dataset</strong>,
        obtained from the <strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository</strong>. The dataset contains
        academic, demographic, social, and behavioral information for secondary school students
        enrolled in a mathematics course. Each row represents an individual student, and each
        column represents a specific attribute related to performance or background.
    </p>

    <h3>API Data Collection (Contextual Data)</h3>

    <p>
        In addition to the primary dataset, external contextual data was collected using
        the <strong>World Bank Open Data API</strong>. This API was used to retrieve
        country-level education and technology indicators in order to provide broader
        educational context. These indicators were used for contextual understanding
        and were not merged at the individual student level.

    <!-- CLEANING SECTION -->
    <!-- ===================== -->

    <h3>Data Cleaning and Preparation</h3>

    <p>
        Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Python to ensure the dataset
        was accurate, consistent, and suitable for exploration. The dataset was inspected
        for missing values, incorrect entries, and duplicate records. No missing values
        were found in the dataset, and all data types were verified for correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additional preparation steps included reviewing numerical ranges to identify
        potential outliers and creating a derived performance category based on the final
        grade. These steps ensured that the data was well-structured and ready for
        exploratory analysis.

    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>

<p>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand distributions,
relationships, and patterns within the student performance dataset.
The following visualizations explore how academic outcomes relate to
study habits, attendance, family background, and lifestyle factors.

        <strong>Figure 1: Distribution of Final Grades.</strong>
        Most students score in the mid-range, with fewer extreme high or low values,
        indicating balanced academic performance across the dataset.

        <strong>Figure 2: Study Time vs Final Grade.</strong>
        Higher study time levels are generally associated with higher median grades,
        suggesting that consistent study habits positively influence performance.

<figure>
    <img src="fig_age_distribution.png" alt="Age Distribution">
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 9: Age Distribution of Students.</strong>
        Most students fall within a narrow age range, suggesting performance differences
        are more influenced by behavioral and contextual factors than age.

    <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 10: Parallel Coordinates of Student Behavior and Academic Performance.</strong>
        This parallel coordinates plot visualizes multiple student attributes simultaneously, including study time, number of absences, social activity, alcohol consumption, and final grade. Each line represents an individual student, with color intensity indicating the final grade achieved. Students with higher final grades generally follow patterns of higher study time and lower absences, while students with lower grades tend to show greater variability across lifestyle and attendance factors. The visualization highlights how academic performance is influenced by a combination of behaviors rather than a single factor, emphasizing the complex interactions between study habits, attendance, and lifestyle choices.
